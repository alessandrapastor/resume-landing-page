  <!-- ABOUT SECTION -->
  <section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I’m a third-year Division I student-athlete at Long Island University, 
      majoring in Artificial Intelligence. My passion for technology began in 
      high school, exploring early computer science concepts that led me to the world of artificial intelligence. 
      At LIU, I'm committed to integrating my academic pursuits with my love for 
      athletics — I apply the same discipline that fuels my track and field 
      performance to my research and internships.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond the classroom, I've embraced leadership opportunities on campus, 
      collaborating with fellow students on cutting-edge projects. 
      My experiences both on the track and in the classroom have taught me invaluable 
      lessons in teamwork, problem-solving, and resilience. Whether I'm competing 
      or coding, I strive to push boundaries and deliver my best.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of my core studies, I'm fascinated by the intersection of 
      <strong>sports technology and AI</strong>. My goal is to harness 
      machine learning to optimize athletic training routines, enhance injury 
      prevention, and ultimately support peak human performance.
